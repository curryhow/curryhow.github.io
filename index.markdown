The Curry-Howard correspondence is an isomorphism between a logic (intuitionistic sequent calculus) and a programming language (simply-typed lambda calculus). This website will eventually host a complete course in the fundamentals of logic and theoretical computer science, leading up to a proof of the Curry-Howard correspondence. We are part of the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/home) at the University of Melbourne.

## Original seminar

#### S2 2016 - Curry-Howard correspondence

Our aim was to read Sorensen and Urzyczyn's book "Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism", up to the proof of the original Curry-Howard correspondence (between simply-typed lambda calculus and intuitionistic logic) in Chapter 4.

  * 14-7 William Troiani "The Church-Rosser Theorem" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-will-churchrosser.pdf))
  * 2-8 William Troiani "Introduction to lambda calculus" (Sections 1.1-1.3, [lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-will-lambda.pdf))
  * 9-8 Samuel Lyons "All partial recursive functions are lambda-definable" (Section 1.7, [lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-sam-definable.pdf))
  * 16-8 James Clift "Simply-typed lambda calculus and strong normalisation" (Chapter 3, [lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-james-simplytyped.pdf))
  * 23-8 Shawn Standefer "Introduction to natural deduction" (Chapter 2, [lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-shawn-introintuit.pdf))
  * 30-8 Daniel Murfet "The category of simply-typed lambda terms" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-catsimplytyped.pdf))
  * 6-9 Shawn Standefer "Kripke semantics of intuitionistic logic" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-shawn-kripke.pdf))
  * 13-9 **No talk**, instead we'll watch Wadler's [Propositions as types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU) and discuss
  * 20-9 Daniel Murfet "The category of simply-typed lambda terms II" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-catsimplytyped2.pdf) and an [appendix](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-catsimplytyped2-cuts.pdf))
  * 4-10 Daniel Murfet "The Curry-Howard principle" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-ch.pdf))
  * 11-10 James Clift "System F: Polymorphic lambda calculus" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-james-systemF.pdf))
  * 18-10 William Troiani "System F in the real world: Haskell and functional programming" ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-will-haskell.pdf)) (the referenced talk by Rich Hickey is "[Simple made easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)")
  
Thanks to Camillo Fiorentini for noticing errors in the original notes for the lecture on strong normalisation, and for suggesting the fix (incorporated in the current version).
